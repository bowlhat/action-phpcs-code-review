> **⚠️ Note:** To use this GitHub Action, you must have access to GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions are currently only available in public beta. You can [apply for Github Actions beta access here](https://github.com/features/actions).

This action is a part of [GitHub Actions Library](https://github.com/rtCamp/github-actions-library/) created by [rtCamp](https://github.com/rtCamp/).

# PHPCS Code Review - GitHub Action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to perform automated [pull request review](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-reviews). It is based on https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-ci/ but can be used for any WordPress or even PHP projects.

The code review is performed using [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).

Please note that, this action performs pull request review *only*. If you have an existing project, and you want entire project's code to be reviwed, you may need to do it manually.

## Usage

1. Create a `.github/phpcs.yml` in your GitHub repo, if one doesn't exist already.
2. Add the following code to the `phpcs.yml` file.

```yaml
name: Run PHPCS on pull requests

on: pull_request

jobs:
  phpcs:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - uses: rtCamp/action-phpcs-code-review@master
      env:
        GH_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_BOT_TOKEN }}
      with:
        args: "WordPress,WordPress-Core,WordPress-Docs"
```

3. Define `GH_BOT_TOKEN` using [GitHub Action's Secret](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/storing-secrets). See [GitHub Token Creation](#github-token-creation) section for more details.

Now, next time you create a pull request or commit on an existing pull request, this action will run.

By default, pull request will be reviwed using WordPress coding and documentation standards. You can change the default by passing different [PHPCS Coding Standard(s)](#phpcs-coding-standards) in line `args = ["WordPress-Core,WordPress-Docs"]`.

## GitHub Token Creation

You can create [GitHub Token from here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

It is recommended that you create this token from a [bot user account](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29177936/4108721). In a large team, if you use your human account token, you may get flooded with unncessary Github notifications.

Permissions required for this token differ according to which type of repo this workflow has been setup for.

Repo Type | Permissions Required                                | Screenshots
----------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
Public    | Under `Repo` section, only `public_repo` permission | [Screenshot Public Repo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4115/54978322-01926100-4fc6-11e9-8da5-1e088fa52b34.png)
Private   | Complete `repo` and `write:discussion` permissions  | [Screenshot Private Repo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4115/54978180-86c94600-4fc5-11e9-846e-7d3fd1dfb7e0.png)

## PHPCS Coding Standards

Below is list of PHPCS sniffs available at runtime. You can pass more than one standard at a time by comma separated value.

By default, `WordPress-Core,WordPress-Docs` value is passed.

* MySource
* PEAR
* PHPCompatibility
* PHPCompatibilityParagonieRandomCompat
* PHPCompatibilityParagonieSodiumCompat
* PHPCompatibilityWP
* PSR1
* PSR12
* PSR2
* Squiz
* WordPress _(default)_
* WordPress-Core _(default)_
* WordPress-Docs _(default)_
* WordPress-Extra
* WordPress-VIP
* WordPress-VIP-Go
* WordPressVIPMinimum
* Zend

### Custom Sniffs

If your git repo have a file named `phpcs.xml` in the root of the repository, then that will take precedence. In that case, value passed to args such as `args = ["WordPress,WordPress-Core,WordPress-Docs"]` will be ignored.

If your git repo doesn't have `phpcs.xml` and you do not specify `args` in `main.workflow` PHPCS action, then this actions will fallback to default.

Here is a sample [phpcs.xml](https://github.com/rtCamp/github-actions-wordpress-skeleton/blob/master/phpcs.xml) you can use in case you want to use custom sniffs.

1. This action runs only for PRs. It even runs on new commits pushed after a PR is created.
2. This action doesn't run on code in the repository added before this action.
3. This action doesn't run for code committed directly to a branch. We highly recommend that you disable direct commits to your main/master branch.
